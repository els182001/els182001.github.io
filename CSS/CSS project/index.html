      <p>Hello! My name is Elliot Stern and am a senior at the University of Colorado Boulder. This website is built to show who I am and all the things I like to do.</p>

      <p>I am currently studying Marketing in the Leeds school of Business with a minor in Creative Technology and Design.</p>

      <p>When it comes to my career I have worked many jobs. I first started working at Firehouse Subs then window cleaning, moving, and lastly as a Brand Representative for Jiant. My current job as a Brand Representative has really shown me that I am interested in Sales. In my final year of school I am looking to take in as much knowledge as possible to excel in my future endevours.</p>

      <p>I have grown up playing baseball as my main sport. The qualities I learned through those 16 years taught me to be a great leader and friend.</p>

      <p>As a social person I like to work with people and spend my freetime socializing as well.</p>
